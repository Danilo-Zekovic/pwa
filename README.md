Trying to make it from scratch

I was thinking of modifying existing templates for react app, but after some thinking
 I decided to make my own structure and that way understand better how everything works.
 If this experiment is successuful I will set some time a side and write a detailed tutorial
 how to build PWAs.

## Running the app
To run webpack dev server:   
  npm test

To create a bundle:   
  npm run build

To run server after bundle is made:   
  npm start


## Forever
 usage: forever [start | stop | stopall | list] [options] SCRIPT [script options]    

options:   
  start     -->  start SCRIPT as a daemon    
  stop      -->  stop the daemon SCRIPT    
  stopall   -->  stop all running forever scripts    
  list      -->  list all running forever scripts  


## MongoDB
sudo systemctl start mongod    
sudo systemctl stop mongod      
sudo systemctl reload mongod     
sudo systemctl restart mongod
