# pwa
Trying to make it from scratch

I was thinking of modifying existing templates for react app, but after some thinking
 I decided to make my own structure and that way understand better how everything works.
 If this experiment is successuful I will set some time a side and write a detailed tutorial
 how to build PWAs.
