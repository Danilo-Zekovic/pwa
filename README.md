# pwa
Trying to make it from scratch

I was thinking of modifying existing templates for react app, but after some thinking
 I decided to make my own structure and that way understand better how everything works.
 If this experiment is successuful I will set some time a side and write a detailed tutorial
 how to build PWAs.

## Running the app
To run webpack dev server:
  npm start

To create a bundle:
  npm run build

To run server after bundle is made:
  node server.js


## Forever
 usage: forever [start | stop | stopall | list] [options] SCRIPT [script options]

options:
  start          start SCRIPT as a daemon
  stop           stop the daemon SCRIPT
  stopall        stop all running forever scripts
  list           list all running forever scripts
