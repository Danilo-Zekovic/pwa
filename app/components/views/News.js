    <h1>OFFICIAL POSTER COMPETITIONS FOR PYEONGCHANG 2018 LAUNCHED</h1><br/>
    <p>IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA’S MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS AND TOURISM, THE PYEONGCHANG ORGANISING COMMITTEE FOR THE 2018 OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC WINTER GAMES (POCOG) HAS LAUNCHED A COMPETITION FOR THE DESIGN OF POSTERS PROMOTING BOTH EVENTS.<br/><br/>


The open call for entries began on Tuesday May 2, with a briefing session due to take place at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Seoul on May 18. Entrants may submit their applications between 24 and 31 July, with the winners to be announced this September.<br/><br/>

The 10 winning designs for both the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games will go on display at a number of museums and art galleries across the country, among them the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art and the Gangneung Art Centre. The winning artists will each receive 10 million Korean won and will also have their work archived by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).<br/><br/>

In engaging a wide range of artists and giving them the opportunity to have their work showcased on a global stage, the poster competition seeks to draw on their creativity to promote the spirit of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and convey its messages and themes in a variety of ways.<br/><br/>

Entries will be judged on their ability to express the idea of the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 as a festival of unity, togetherness and joy, and to reflect the values, ideals and vision of the Games and the character of both the Republic of Korea and PyeongChang.<br/><br/>

POCOG is hoping to attract unique designs that set PyeongChang 2018 apart from previous Winter Games. “We hope that the official art poster competition for both the Olympic and Paralympic Games will attract some of our top artists,” said POCOG President Lee Hee-beom. “We trust it will give them an opportunity to create something special that will allow us to celebrate and commemorate this wonderful global festival of sport and culture to be hosted in our country next year.<br/><br/>

“The winning designs will form an incredible collection that embodies our culture, our traditions and the progress we have made, giving the world a glimpse of the Republic of Korea through art,” added the POCOG President. “I look forward to seeing the entries and seeing the various ways in which people use art to express the Games.”<br/><br/>

Open to anyone aged 19 or over on 2 May 2017, the poster competition is aimed at artists with a background in design or fine arts, with entrants allowed to submit a maximum of two designs for both Games.</p>
